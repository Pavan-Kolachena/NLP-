# Stemming and Lemmatization

Both in the stemming and lemmatization we will reduce the word to the base root form but the difference lies in their approach.

In stemming we will reduce the word to their base root form by reducing the suffix of the word and these words may be or may not be in dictionary.It is a Quick and Dirty Approach 
This is used in search engines , text classification tasks etc

In Lemmatization also we will reducethe word to the base root form but the words wll be in dictionary, this is computationally expensive and this is used in sentiment analysis and machine translation etc.

for ex In lemmatization running word will be there even after lemmatization as the word itself is having a meaning
